# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository documents the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system, demonstrating key concepts and practices in software development planning.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the SDLC where project teams gather, analyze, and define software requirements. It ensures all stakeholders have a clear understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Clarity and Understanding**: Reduces ambiguity by clearly defining stakeholder expectations
- **Scope Definition**: Prevents scope creep by establishing clear project boundaries
- **Cost and Time Estimation**: Enables accurate project planning and resource allocation

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering**: Collecting initial requirements through interviews, surveys, and workshops
- **Requirement Elicitation**: Refining requirements using brainstorming, focus groups, and prototyping
- **Requirement Documentation**: Creating detailed requirement specifications and user stories
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**: Prioritizing requirements and creating visual models
- **Requirement Validation**: Reviewing requirements with stakeholders and defining acceptance criteria

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
Define what the system should do:
- User registration and authentication
- Property search with filters (location, price, availability)
- Booking system for reservations
- Property listings with details and images

### Non-functional Requirements
Define how the system should perform:
- **Performance**: Pages load within 2 seconds, support 1000 concurrent users
- **Security**: Data encryption and protection against vulnerabilities
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling capability
- **Usability**: Intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime

## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams visually represent interactions between users (actors) and the system. They help identify system functionalities and facilitate communication among stakeholders.

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria define the conditions a feature must meet for stakeholder approval. They ensure clarity and provide a basis for testing.

**Example - Checkout Feature**:
- User must be able to select available dates from a calendar
- System displays total price including all fees before confirmation
- User receives booking confirmation email within 2 minutes
- Payment processing completes securely within 30 seconds
- Booking details are immediately visible in user's dashboard
